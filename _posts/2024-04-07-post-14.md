The nuances and characteristics of short-term memory (STM) are often explored through simple methodologies, such as the use of basic images or sequences of numbers. The insights derived from these investigations highlight a fundamental limitation within our working memory capabilities. On average, an individual can maintain about 5 to 7 pieces of information in their working memory. Moreover, the retention span of these items is remarkably brief; without deliberate rehearsal, information begins to fade after approximately 12 seconds. This limitation appears to be in stark contrast with our experiences of complex activities like reading comprehension or watching movies, during which the process of information retention seems almost effortless. Generally, individuals are capable of understanding and remembering the narrative of a film or the content of a book without noticeable difficulty, even when unexpectedly asked to recall specific details.

This discrepancy suggests that the conventional mechanism of STM, while adequate for accounting for memory function during unfamiliar tasks, does not fully explain the capacity for memory retention in more complex or skilled activities. In these instances, the information accessible to an individual evolves as they engage with the task, creating what is informally recognized as examples of working memory.

In this discussion, we propose a comprehensive framework for understanding working memory, which includes not only the traditional concept of short-term working memory (ST-WM) but also introduces the notion of long-term working memory (LT-WM). LT-WM is characterized by its reliance on the stable storage capabilities of long-term memory (LTM) and the strategic use of retrieval cues from ST-WM for information access. The distinction between LT-WM and ST-WM lies in the durability of storage and the necessity of effective retrieval cues to access stored information.

Cognitive processes, historically described as a sequence of thoughts or states, are fundamentally mediated by memory. This dependency is not only shaped by memory itself but also by the interaction with environmental factors. The consensus among scholars, tracing back to Aristotle, acknowledges that complex cognitive functions, such as thinking, are sequences of cognitive states. For instance, Newell and Simon (1972) emphasized the role of STM in delineating the sequence of mental states within cognitive processes. More recent theories, such as Anderson's distinction between macro and micro processes, and Kintsch's model of text comprehension, further elaborate on how cognitive processes involve stable products and the integration of new information with existing knowledge stored in memory.

A significant part of understanding cognitive processes involves examining how individuals construct and store representations of information in LTM, particularly through activities like text comprehension. The process entails the encoding of individual segments of text and the subsequent maintenance of these representations in working memory, enabling successful integration with new information. The retention of text information varies across different levels, including the surface structure, textbase, and the situation model, with each level demonstrating distinct patterns of memory retention.

The exploration of memory, especially in the context of complex cognitive activities, reveals a dynamic interplay between short-term and long-term memory systems. By recognizing the contributions of both ST-WM and LT-WM, this framework provides a more nuanced understanding of how information is stored, accessed, and utilized in skilled activities. This perspective not only acknowledges the limitations of short-term memory in isolation but also highlights the intricate mechanisms that facilitate our ability to engage in complex cognitive tasks with apparent ease.
