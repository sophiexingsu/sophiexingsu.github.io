This is a matcha basque cheesecake with strawberries I made for a Thanksgiving dinner.

Basque Cheesecake is quite easy to make as it only involves mixing all the ingredients using a spatula. However, after many failed attempts and products that received complaints not only from my friends but were also left relatively uneaten, there are some tips I learned:

- **Cream Cheese**: Leave your cream cheese at room temperature for at least 8 hours. If it is still cold and hard when you start making the cheesecake, it will be very difficult to incorporate well with other ingredients and will result in many crumbs and curdles in your mixture.

- **Sugar**: Add the amount of sugar as instructed. There are many good recipes for a Basque cheesecake online. Here is the [Chinese recipe](https://m.xiachufang.com/recipe/107118466/) followed for this particular matcha Basque cheesecake. The amount of sugar needed for this cake seems to be abnormally high, but trust me, it's necessary as it helps with masking the taste of unseasoned eggs.

- **Sifting**: Sifting your cake batter is a must! If you don't want your cake to have weird textures or some bits of uncooked batter in the middle of your cake, please sift your cake batter! It can remedy some damage you might have caused if you didn't let your cream cheese rest to room temperature fully. You will see many unincorporated cream cheese pieces left in your sifter.

Here is the matcha Basque cheesecake straight from the oven:

I simply decorated it with strawberries and powdered sugar for the final product.
