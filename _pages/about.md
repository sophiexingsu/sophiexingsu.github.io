# Hello and Welcome!

## About Me
I'm a third-year PhD Psychology student at Washington University in St. Louis, diving deep into the brain and behavior's mysteries in [Dr. Jeff Zacks](https://dcl.wustl.edu/people/jzacks/)'s lab. My journey blends computational approaches with dynamic cognition and action control.

Prior to this, my journey in research began at the Haskins Lab, focusing on dyslexia. I earned my bachelor's degrees in Economics and Psychology from Cornell University, where I collaborated with [Dr. Khena Swallow](https://psychology.cornell.edu/khena-m-swallow).

When I'm not brainstorming or number-crunching, I write essays in both [Chinese](/files/Sophie_Su_CV.pdf) and English and bake cakes that are as much a science experiment as a treat. Check out my cake [gallery](//portfolio/) for a peek at my baking escapades.

Curious about my professional path or what's cooking in my mind? Here's my [CV](/files/wechat.bmp) and [blog](/year-archive/)  for more!
