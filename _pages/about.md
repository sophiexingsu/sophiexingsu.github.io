Hello and Welcome!
======

I'm a third-year PhD Psychology student at Washington University in St. Louis, diving deep into the brain and behavior's mysteries in [Dr. Jeff Zacks](https://dcl.wustl.edu/people/jzacks/)'s lab. My journey blends computational approaches with dynamic cognition and action control.

Before this, I cut my research teeth at the Haskins Lab on dyslexia projects and bagged my bachelor's in Economics and Psychology from Cornell, where I had the chance to work with [Dr.Khena Swallow](https://psychology.cornell.edu/khena-m-swallow). <br/>

When I'm not mentalizing or number-crunching, I write essays in both Chinese and English and bake cakes that are as much a science experiment as a treat. Check out my cake [gallery](//portfolio/) for a peek at my baking escapades.

Curious about my professional path or what's cooking in my mind? Here's my [CV](/files/Sophie_Su_CV.pdf) and blog](/year-archive/)  for more!
