# Hello and Welcome!

## About Me
I'm a  fourth-year Psychology PhD student at WashU completing the [Cognitive, Computational and Systems Neuroscience Pathway](https://sites.wustl.edu/systemsneuroscience/ccsn-pathway/), and diving deep into the brain and behavior's mysteries in [Dr. Jeff Zacks](https://dcl.wustl.edu/people/jzacks/)'s lab. My journey blends computational approaches with dynamic cognition and action control.

Prior to this, I was in [Dr.Nicole Landi's Lab](https://psychology.uconn.edu/person/nicole-landi/) applying Imaging genetics methods to understand the mechanisms of dyslexia. I earned my bachelor's degrees in Economics and Psychology from Cornell University, where I collaborated with [Dr. Khena Swallow](https://psychology.cornell.edu/khena-m-swallow).

When I'm not brainstorming or number-crunching, I write essays in both [Chinese](/files/wechat.bmp) and English and bake cakes that are as much a science experiment as a treat. Check out my cake [gallery](/portfolio/) for a peek at my baking escapades. 

Curious about my academic journey or what's cooking in my mind? Here's my [CV](/files/Sophie_Su_CV.pdf) and [blog](/year-archive/) for more !

## Inferring Mental Processes from Gaze Patterns

Can we decode cognitive processes by analyzing where people look? This research explores how gaze patterns during natural viewing reveal our internal models of the world.

#### Latest Finding: Predictive Looking in Everyday Activities

Our recently revised paper in JEP: General reveals that:

- üëÅÔ∏è Viewers predict actors' hand movements up to 9 seconds in advance
- üß† Prediction errors (not uncertainty) align with computational models of event perception
- üîç Increased prediction errors occur at event boundaries

This provides strong evidence that prediction errors drive how we segment continuous experience into discrete events.

### Current Direction:

Investigating how mental models update (incrementally vs. globally) and whether gaze patterns reveal hierarchical structures in our cognitive representations.
