Hi, My name is Sophie Su (苏醒), welcome to my personal page
======

I am a first year PhD student working with Dr.Jeff Zacks at Washington University in Saint Louis. I am interested in computational approaches, dynamic cognition and action control.  <br/>
Before WashU, I was at Haskins Lab, work on an imaging-genetics projects of dyslexia. <br/>
I graduated from Cornell with a degree in Economics and Psychology.
Here is my [CV](/files/Sophie_Su_CV_2022.pdf), and if you want to know what I am thinking right now, here is my [blog](/_portfolio)
