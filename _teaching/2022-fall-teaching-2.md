As the Assistant to the Instructor for the course 'The Psychology of Learning,' I facilitated two comprehensive review sessions. These sessions involved the creation of detailed presentation slides and the delivery of lectures focused on key topics covered in the course.  I also host weekly office hours and graded writing assignments as well as exams.
