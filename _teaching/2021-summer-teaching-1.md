As the teaching assistant for Computational Neuroscience, I guided 12 master-level students in utilizing Python and Google Colab for 20 diverse projects, encompassing topics from causal inference to machine learning algorithms. Provided expert Python coding assistance, created supplementary tutorials for complex concepts, and elucidated algorithmic logic. I also played a pivotal role as a mentor in brain-storm, literature review,model selection, and debugging assistance for three diverse projects. These projects, which encompassed domains such as behavioral analysis and single-neuron spiking patterns. Guided these projects from their initial conceptualization through to the analytical phase.
